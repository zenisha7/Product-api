Project Overview:

This is the Asp.NetCore mvc solution based on product backend api
that handles company's internal products. The data manipulation is 
handled via Entity framewoek core. Also c# was used as a primary 
language. A devOps practise was adopted for construction of this 
project. It is also deployed using docker so that the project also
runs in docker container. Also, additional technology such as Moq 
and Nunits is used.
